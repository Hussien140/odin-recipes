    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise.</p>
    <p>You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>YeastActive dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise.</li>
        <li>Sugar To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and speeds up the activation process. You'll know your yeast is active when it becomes bubbly and frothy on top</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Let the Dough Come to Room Temperature After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest on the counter for about 5 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax, making the dough much easier to stretch and shape.</li>
    </ol>
